PhotoJShop
==========

A JavaScript library for photo editing using the canvas, aiming to reproduce most usual filters.
A demo of its capabilities can be seen in [Nuophoto](https://github.com/aurbano/nuophoto), a project that uses this library for all the editing.

It's still under development, right now it is just a copy/paste from the library that was used initially in Nuophoto. I still have to improve this and make it more independent so that it could eventually be used on standalone images.

Ideally a developer would grab a copy of this library, and allow users to put filters to their photos directly.
